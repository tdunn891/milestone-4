## Purpose

TrackIt was developed to provide organisations of all types an intuitive, lightweight system to log, track and resolve issues without the admin burden. In a live environment, this application would be deployed within an organisation. For example, a non-technical employee (Submitter) submits a 'Bug' to flag an internal software issue. A technical staff member (Assignee) is then assigned the Ticket and works to resolve. Or say an employee has a time-saving idea for a new software feature, they can submit a 'Feature Request' which is then assigned and tracked through to implementation. As proof of concept, the site itself was used track bugs and features during development.

## UX

### 5 Planes of UX

#### Strategy

Setting the UX strategy requires understanding the needs of the target users:

Ticket Submitters want:

- a straightforward ticket submission process
- feedback to be assured that their issue is being worked
- to spend minimal time on the site so they can return to their core tasks

Ticket Assignees want:

- Lots of detail about the ticket, including screenshots
- Input from other users who may be experiencing the same Bug or want the same Feature Request
- Ability to reassign to another Assignee if required
- Graphs to gain insights - for example High Priority or aging tickets that require attention

Taking the above into account, the User Experience must be clean, fast, and intuitive.

#### Scope

##### Functional Specifications

Existing issue trackers were researched (eg Jira, GitHub Issues) to identify key functionality users expect:

- Submitting and tracking of 'Bugs' and 'Feature Requests' through to resolution.
- Contributions from other users to speed up resolution.
- Dashboard View of all tickets
- KANBAN View

##### Content Requirements

- Data tables
- Input boxes for ticket filtering
- DC.js, D3.js and crossfilter for dashboard charts
- Dropdowns for selecting and editing fields
- File Upload buttons

#### Structure

##### Interaction Design

- Unobtrusive navigation bar, always accessible and fixed to top
- On mobile and tablet devices, navigation links collapse into a menu button
- All interactive elements provide feedback to the user to encourage interaction and confirm user actions
- Each row in tickets table changes opacity on hover
- Navigation and pagination links change opacity on hover
- All buttons have border transition on hover
- Tooltips on icons on hover
- Form validation exists for relevant fields
- Dropdown messages confirm: User Logged In , User Logged Out, Ticket Added, Ticket Edited, Ticket Upvoted, Comment Submitted, Payment Provided.

##### Information Architecture

- A multipage architecture was used to break up the large amount of information presented in the site. For example, the Add Ticket, Edit Ticket and Checkout pages require many fields and so require separate pages.
- Pagination is employed in the tickets table to reduce cognitive overload. User can select how many tickets to display per page via dropdown.

#### Skeleton

##### Wireframes

Two sets of wireframes were created in the early development stage to set out the structure and layout on different device sizes.

[Desktop & Mobile Wireframes](https://github.com/tdunn891/milestone-4/tree/master/wireframes)

#### Surface

Colours: Intuitive ticket colours used consistently to represent Ticket Status - Green: Resolved, Yellow: In Progress, Grey: Cancelled, Blue: New.

## Features

### Pages

#### Home

The Home page provides a quick introduction to the site, featuring minimal, easy to digest sections on Features, User Testimonials, Trusted By, Plans and Frequently Asked Questions. If the user is not signed in, the call to action buttons are to **Create Free Account**. If the user is already signed in, their username and profile picture will be displayed in the navigation bar and links to the Account page. If the user is signed in but not a Pro User, the call to action buttons are to **Go PRO**, The Go PRO buttons link to the Checkout page, where the user can pay to upgrade their account.

![Home View](static/images/home-view.png)

#### Tickets

The Tickets page allows sorting and filtering of existing tickets, and a link to create a new ticket. The table shows key information for each ticket. Clicking on the row opens the **View Ticket** page for further details. Each field can be sorted both directions, and general and field-specific search input is available.

![Tickets View](static/images/tickets-view.png)

#### View Ticket

The View Ticket page provides additional ticket information, including the Description, Tags, Days to Resolve (if Resolved), Age (if not Resolved) and Recent Activity. If the user is the Submitter or Staff, the **Edit Ticket** and **Status** buttons will be displayed and the user will have permission to change the Status via the dropdown, and to access the Edit Ticket page. The **Upvote** button displays how many upvotes the ticket has received, and increments on click. Profile pictures for Submitter and Assignee are displayed.

The **Change History** tab allows the user to see a timeline of what has changed, when, and by whom. The **Recent Activity** section shows this in a more intuitive way. The **Comments** section displayed below the ticket allows anyone to leave a comment, which helps to speed up resolution of the ticket.

![View Ticket](static/images/view-ticket.png)

#### Add Ticket

Basic users can submit up to 10 tickets per month via the Add Ticket form. A message is displayed showing how many they have used in current month:

![Add Ticket Basic User](static/images/add-ticket-basic-user.png)

#### Edit Ticket

The Edit ticket form is accessible by the ticket's Submitter and Staff. Possible edits include reassigning the ticket, upgrading/downgrading its Priority, editing Description, Tags, Summary, uploading a screenshot.

#### Dashboard

Dashboard page allows visual interaction with the tickets data across 6 interconnected charts. Clicking a segment on the row and pie charts or dragging to select a date range will filter all charts.

![Dashboard](static/images/dashboard-view.png)

#### KANBAN (PRO Feature)

Tickets are displayed in KANBAN columns by Status: New, In Progress, Resolved, Cancelled. Given that Cancelled tickets may be less important to some users, the 'Hide Cancelled' checkbox hides them. If Basic users click the KANBAN navigation link, they are redirected to Checkout page:

![KANBAN Basic User](static/images/kanban-go-pro.png)

###### CI Assessors: please be sure to Go PRO with a test Stripe payment to access KANBAN.

#### Checkout

The user can upgrade their account from Basic to PRO by online credit card payment, processed by Stripe. On successful payment:

![Checkout](static/images/pro-successfully-paid.png)

#### Team

The Team page acts as an address book of users of the site, listing some key details. Users are split into Submitters and Staff.

#### Account

The Account page is where users can view and edit their account information. Users can upload a profile picture from their device, add First and Last Names, add personal Zoom Meeting IDs. The user's account status (Basic or PRO) is displayed, including a 'Go PRO' button if basic user. Submitters can request Admin Access via a link.

## Databases

Sqlite3 was used during development. For deployment, data tables and data was migrated to a PostgreSQL database.

### Data Models

### Data Migration

To ensure a rich dataset for assessment purposes, testing data (including users, tickets) was migrated from sqlite3 to the PostgreSQL database using the following method:

Dump existing data into json format:

`python3 manage.py dumpdata > datadump.json`

Change DATABASES in settings.py to Postgres, then migrate:

`python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb`

Exclude contenttype data:

```
python3 manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
>>> ContentType.objects.all().delete()
>>> quit()
```

Load json data into PostgreSQL:

`python3 manage.py loaddata datadump.json`

   `git clone https://github.com/tdunn891/milestone-4`

2. If your IDE doesn't include a virtual environment, create one (see Python docs: [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

   `python3 venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

3. Activate virtual environment:

   `source /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

4. Install dependencies in requirements.txt via 'pip':

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Create local environment variables in project directory:

   `touch env.py`

   'import os' at top of file, then set each environment variable under the Heroku heading above like so:

   `os.environ.setdefault("<variable>","<value>")`

6. Run app:

   `python3 manage.py runserver`

7. Go to Local Host in browser to view:

   `http://localhost:8000/`
